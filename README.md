A simple dynamic website used for transfer of money between multiple users. The database consists of data of 10-15 dummy customers. No negative or zero value of money can be transferred. The current balance of the sender should be sufficient to send the money otherwise an error message is displayed. Transaction History of all the previous transactions is displayed to the user.
